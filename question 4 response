Q4: 

What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?

PDO (PHP Data Objects) is an extension. It is a PHP extension, and its main function is to provide a consistent interface 
for accessing databases in PHP and allows us to to use and actually interact w databases.

We need prepared statements are a feature that is available because of PDO which allows us to do more with SQL. It is considered
a "best practice' by many for secuirity, performance, clarify, flexibility reasons,and more. Prepared statements can help prevent attacks by separating SQL from data, it can
improve performance bc SQL can now execute the same exact query but using different paramaeters. Also since the code and logic is separate it can make the 
code very readable. So overall its a good practice to use PDO in PHP when working with databases.
